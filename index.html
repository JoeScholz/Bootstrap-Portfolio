                <p>I am an aspiring coder. I have a double major from a university, but that only got me so far. I was happy to find another education program to peak my interest after many years of working in the service industry and at a local television station. I enjoy learning and getting to know new people with diverse backgrounds and personalities. I'm looking forward, though nevously, to the challanges ahead of me in this boot camp and in my search for a new career. 
            </p>
          
                <p>I grew up in Kansas and have lived here for all my life. I love to travel, but it's always great returning to my home. I grew up in the historic town of Atchison on the Missouri River, the birth place of famed aviator, and mystery woman Amelia Earhart. After high school, I came to my new home, Lawrence Kansas, where a life long Jahawk fan could always feel welcome.
            </p>
                <p>I recently married my true love, Katie. Together we have continued our shared interest in travel. For our honeymoonshe led me on my first plane flight and vist across the Atlantic. We spent a couple weeks in Holland driving around, eating smoked fish and visiting museums. I was struck by the VanGoughs in person. I had never expected how alive the textures would make the paintings feel until standing in front of them.
                    I look at coding as another new, challenging, exciting experience. After some study and practice I hop to learn how to express my self though my work. I hopw that a job I may find will lead my to ther new experience and people too meet.
